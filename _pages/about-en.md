"Thiền ca" is a meditation practice that was thought to be a new concept of Plum Village. In reality, it is a creative and extensive application of meditation tradition by Plum Village, which helps people, especially young generations, to easily connect with Buddha's teachings and increase their awareness of the meaning of life. This practice helps individuals to have a better, beautiful, and prosperous life.

In the meditation practice, the master recites various verses while "thỉnh chuông" (inviting the bell), "mõ" (striking the wooden fish), "linh" (inviting the spirit), "tang" (reciting the sutra), etc. Now, it is known as "thiền ca", a form of practice that allows individuals to deeply absorb Buddha's teachings and scriptures. The verses are like holy drops that fall into one's heart, nurturing good seeds, and continuing to water them until they grow into strong and blooming flowers, making life more beautiful and vibrant.

When I first visited Plum Village in the summer of 1987, I heard the song "Ý thức em mặt trời tỏ rạng" ("Awareness shining like the sun") sung by Ha Thanh. The song deeply touched, as I felt like waking up from a deep sleep. Buddha said that people suffer because they cannot find their way, as the path of life has countless twists and turns. Without the luck of meeting Buddha and receiving his guidance, we may easily get lost.

Therefore, a meditation song must have gentle and harmonious lyrics and music, reflecting Buddha's intention to guide individuals towards peace. "May thay trong cõi ta bà, đâu cũng có cánh tay đức Từ Bi cứu độ" ("Fortunately, in this world, everywhere there are the merciful hands of bodhisattva Avalokitesvara to save us"). If individuals do not practice to achieve the awareness shining like the sun, they will hardly see the finger pointing the way of Buddha and will not have the determination to follow his path to attain freedom.

Thus, a meditation song must awaken individuals from their slumber, remove their sorrow, and remind them to care for their mind and body before doing or saying anything. The song "Thở vào thở ra" ("Breathing in, breathing out") is a basic song that I loves to sing in various languages to remind them to wake up and take care of their inner selves. This practice helps to calm the mind, refresh it like flowers, and make it sturdy like mountains, peaceful like lakes, and expansive like space, free from any entanglement. The singer and the listener must genuinely live in what they sing and hear to nourish good seeds within themselves and offer flowers and fruits to themselves and others.
