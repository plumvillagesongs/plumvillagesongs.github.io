People usually think that mindfulness song singing is that is a new practice in Plum Village. Actually, it is a meditation tradition that Plum Village creatively and widely applies so that contemporary people, especially young people, can easily access the Buddha's teachings. It helps them become more conscious of the meaning of life and makes their lives better, more beautiful, and more abundant.

In the practice of meditation, the monks and nuns recite sutras while ringing bells, striking wooden fish, playing chimes, etc. Nowadays, this is understood as "thiền ca," a form of practice that helps practitioners internalize the Buddha's teachings, like drops of dew falling onto the soil of their hearts, nourishing the good seeds and continuing to water them so that they grow strong and blossom, making life more beautiful.

When I first came to Plum Village in the summer of 1987, I heard the song "Awareness is the Sunlight" sung by the singer Ha Thanh in a tape player. I was deeply moved, as if I were waking up from a deep sleep. The Buddha said that we suffer because we cannot see the way, as there are countless paths in life. If we are not lucky enough to meet the Buddha and be guided by him, we are likely to get lost.

Therefore, a meditation song should have gentle lyrics and music that blend together like the Buddha's intention, with the effect of awakening us from our slumber, no longer writhing in sorrow. The song "Breathing In, Breathing Out" is a basic song that I like to sing in many languages to remind me to wake up and take care of my body and mind before I start doing something or saying something. Only then can I avoid making mistakes that cause myself and others to suffer.

Together with the song, I practice conscious breathing, making my mind and body calm and cool, firm as a mountain, tranquil as a lake, and spacious as the sky, without any distractions. The singer and the listener must truly live with what they are singing or hearing so that the good seeds within each person are truly nourished and grow strong, bearing flowers and fruit for themselves and others.
